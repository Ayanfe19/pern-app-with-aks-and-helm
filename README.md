# PERN APP WITH AKS & HELM

An example project on how to deploy a PERN app, on AKS using helm.

This project is based on one of [Bhargav Bachina's](https://medium.com/@bhargavbachina) Labs. Visit [Bachina Labs](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts) for the complete tutorial.

This is my own implementation of the Lab.
